Parts needed/required (Some optional):

1 x NodeMCU (REQUIRED - Version 1.0 is 100% compatable, others may work with pin number tweaking.)
3 x 220 Ohm resistors (Used with color LEDs)
1 x Green LED
1 x Red LED
1 x Yellow LED
2 x Photoelectric LED
1 x PIR Sensor
1 x MQ Sensor
1 x DHT11 or DHT22 sensor
2 x mercury tilt switch (+ AND gate component)
1 x Movement trigger
1 x knock sensor

Pins used: 

3 - DHT 
D4 - PIR Sensor
D5 - Yellow LED
D1 - Green LED
D2 - Red LED
D6 - Tamper Trigger
D7 - Ambient Light Sensor
A0 - MQ Sensor

Tamper sensor can be built in a number of ways. Most s√≠mple version is a photoelectric LED 
that measures light levels inside device enclosure. (There should be no light inside the
box if the cover is closed.)

A more advanced version would be using logical OR gate circuts with the different components.
I.E. Trigger if detected movement OR device internal light level OR knock sensor triggered.
